Calculator

      I have created a simple *Calculator* using C programming language. 

Smallest_char

      In this program, it finds the smallest character in each word. 

            Ex:-
                  strings - Dog

                  smallest characters - dab (d from Dog)
                                            (a from Cat)
                                            (b from bird)

      In this type of programs we can use a code in another file in our code using *#include "file-name.c". 

            
Sum-of-digits-Recursion

      In this program I have Recurion method to get the sum of digits in a integer.

External-Variable

      In this file, I have created simple programs using external variables. From these codes you can get an idea about how external variables declare, access and initialize.
