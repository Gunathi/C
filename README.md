# C

Calculator

      I have created a simple *Calculator* using C programming language. 

Smallest_char

      In this program, it finds the smallest character in each word. 

            Ex:-
                  strings - Dog
                            Cat
                            Bird
                  smallest characters - dab (d from Dog)
                                            (a from Cat)
                                            (b from bird)


Remove-all-occurrences-of -a-specific-character

      In this program, It removes all occurrences of a special character you entered.

            Ex1:- 
                  inputs :- I love Programming
                            o
                  output :- I lve Prgramming.

Reverse-String

      It reverse the any string you entered.

            Ex:- 
                  input :- hansani            output:- inasnah


Multi-file-programming

      In this type of programs we can use a code in another file in our code using *#include "file-name.c".
